# Class Projects


## 1. Week One (3-4 August 2025)

### activity-1.py
A factorial calculator that uses a while loop. It asks you for a number and calculates its factorial. It also handles negative numbers and invalid inputs too.

### activity-2.py
Temperature analysis using NumPy. Takes a week's temperature data and finds the average, highest, lowest, converts to Fahrenheit, and shows which days were above 20Â°C.

### activity-3.py
Rainfall analysis project. Analyzes a week of rainfall data, finds total/average rainfall, counts dry days, and does some statistical stuff with percentiles.

## How to run them

Just open your terminal and run:
```bash
python week-1/activity-1.py  #  Factorial calculator
python week-1/activity-2.py  # Temperature analysis
python week-1/activity-3.py  # Rainfall analysis
```
You'll need Python and NumPy installed (`pip install numpy`).
